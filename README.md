# Spatial Audio

This application adds binaural cues to a mono audio source to create stereo output.  The cues are calculated from:

* the audio source position as a function of time
* the listener position as a funciton of time
* the interaural time difference (ITD)
* the interaural level difference (ILD)
* the gain profile of the ear as a function of squint angle to a source

This application is written in QuickBasic.  It can be run on modern systems using https://qb64.com/.
